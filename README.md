## Abstract

Enhancing the lifetime of qubits with quantum code-based memories on different quantum hardware is a significant step towards fault-tolerant quantum 
computing. We theoretically show that the break-even point, i.e., preserving arbitrary quantum information  longer than the lifetime of a single idle 
qubit, can be beaten even with the quantum phase-flip repetition code in a dephasing-time-limited system. Applying circuit-based analytical calculation, we 
determine the efficiency of the phase-flip code as a quantum memory in the presence of relaxation, dephasing, and faulty quantum gates. Considering current 
platforms for quantum computing, we identify the gate error probabilities and optimal repetition number of quantum error correction cycles to reach the 
break-even point.
